## Workshop Goals and Format

### Goals

The goal of this workshop is to bring together community leaders and practitioners in scientific software for the purpose of identifying the challenges and priority research direction for improving the quality of science.  We want to explore, characterize and articulate who does what.

We will write a workshop report to describe our findings and articulate research priorities that will advance TRES. We anticipate that the diverse experience of the workshop attendees will lead to a deeper awareness and understanding of how the represented communities can benefit from collaboration, coordination and complementarity.
